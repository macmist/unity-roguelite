# unity-roguelite

## Description
This is an attempt at a rogue lite game in 2D using Unity.


## Why this project?
I was playing a bunch of roguelikes/lites but was too bad at them so I've decided to try my own instead!

More seriously, I always wondered how games were made, and tried a couple with more or less success.

This time I wanted to do something on the long run, bit by bit. And roguelites have a lot of features that
I'm interested in learning (level generation, seeded games, items with effects, and more), so that's why
I've decided to give it a go.


## Technologies and resources used
The game is built with Unity, in 2D.

Assets come from various free sources, such as:
- [itch.io](https://itch.io/game-assets)
- [Open Game Art](https://opengameart.org/)

Code is a mix between what I create personally, and what I find in various tutorials that I then refactor
to my own sauce.


## Current state
Still in early development stage.

Latest addition is a skeleton ennemy following the player, that the player can shoot, make bleed and kill.

## How to play
Currently, the game is in a too early stage to create any downloadble package. If you want to try it feel free to download the repo and run it into Unity.
